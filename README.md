# Employee-Tracker

## Description

Created an interface so that it is easy for non-developers to easily view and interact with information within a database. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). My assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Note this application can be started in the command line by running 'node.index.js' after all files are installed.
